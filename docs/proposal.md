• Problem statement
  - The healthcare system lacks transparent and accessible pricing information for medical services and prescription drugs. Patients are unable to accurately estimate out-of-pocket costs before receiving care.

• Target users
  - Insured patients estimating out-of-pocket costs
  - Uninsured or underinsured patients comparing options 
  - Low-income families or individuals

• Solution overview
  - Patients enter basic information (location, insurance type, service or medication) and receive AI-generated cost estimates for doctor visits, common procedures, or prescriptions. The app compares options and identifies the lowest-cost.

• Tech stack justification

  The AI (running locally via Ollama):
  - Keeps data private
  - Normalizes user input
  - Generates understandable explanations
  - Handles incomplete or vague queries gracefully
